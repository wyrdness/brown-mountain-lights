## Scientific Studies

### US Geological Survey Investigations

#### 1913 Study
- US Geological Survey (1913). Investigation of Brown Mountain Lights.
  - Finding: Attributed to locomotive headlights
  - Later disproven: Railroad closed in 1916, lights continued

#### 1922 Study  
- US Geological Survey (1922). Follow-up Investigation of Brown Mountain Lights.
  - Findings: Attributed to brush fires, automobile headlights, stationary lights
  - Status: Partial explanation for some modern sightings

### Modern Research

#### Appalachian State University Study
- Appalachian State University (2016). *Modern Analysis of Brown Mountain Lights*.
  - Methodology: Scientific observation and atmospheric analysis
  - Findings: Some lights explained by atmospheric refraction, others inconclusive
  - Conclusion: Phenomenon partially explained

### Atmospheric Physics
- Various researchers. Studies on atmospheric refraction in mountainous terrain.
- Temperature inversion research relevant to Blue Ridge Mountains.

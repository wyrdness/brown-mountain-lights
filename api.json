      "summary": "Mysterious lights near Brown Mountain, North Carolina, reported for 250+ years. Most consistent US light phenomenon. Some lights explained as refraction, but pre-modern sightings remain unexplained.",
      "full": "The Brown Mountain Lights are mysterious light phenomena observed near Brown Mountain in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina. Characterized by pale lights that rise above the mountain with a steady glow in various colors, these lights have been documented since 1771 and appear in Cherokee legends that predate European contact. With over 250 years of documented reports, this is the most historically consistent light phenomenon in the United States. Multiple USGS investigations (1913, 1922) attributed lights to locomotive headlights and car headlights, but the railroad later closed and lights continued. Modern theories include atmospheric refraction, piezoelectric effects from quartz in the mountains, swamp gas, and foxfire. A 2016 study by Appalachian State University was inconclusive. Some modern lights are explained as distant sources refracted through atmospheric layers, but the pre-modern sightings (before automobiles and trains) remain unexplained."
